MsReport
========


Introduction
------------
MsReport is a Python library with that aims to allow simple and standardized
post processing of proteomics data from bottom up mass spectrometry experiments
that was analyzed with MaxQuant, FragPipe, and potentially other data analysis
pipelines.

MsReport is primarily developed as a tool for the Mass Spectrometry Facility at
the Max Perutz Labs (University of Vienna) to facilitate the generation of
Protein and PTM reports.


Release
-------
Development is currently in early alpha and the interface is not yet stable.


Scope
-----
Reader provides access to the outputs generated by a specific software.
The reader is aware of the file structure and naming conventions of the
respective software and allows access to protein and ion tables with
standardized column names and data format.

QTable contains quantitative data from one specific abstraction level,
such as ions or proteins. The data are in a wide format, meaning that the
quantitative data from each sample are stored in a separate column. The
QTable is aware of the experimental design, which are samples and experiments,
and provides convenient access to this data.

- QAnalysis provide high level interface for post-processing data stored in
QTable, such as filtering, normalization, imputation, and statistical testing
with the R package LIMMA

- QPlot allows generation of plots directly from the QTable for quality control
and data analysis.

- QExport
- to amica
- excel report: protein / ptm / combined (Uses the ExcelReport library)
